Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a research intern at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mark Liberman](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~myl/), working on the reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan Language evolutions. I am also leading a project on protecting endangered languages in Sino-Tibetan languages. If this interests you or if there's anything I can help you with, feel free to drop me an email.

**About Me:** I am an undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). Benefiting from [the School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/)'s flexible curriculum, I got the opportunity to take many valuable courses in Communications, Machine Learning, Arts, and Humanities. Besides, I have been dedicated to the interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI, Social Sciences, Humanities, and Statistics since my freshman year, including:

- Rethinking AI from a human lens: Machine Unlearning([WWW'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02835)), Language Acquisition.
- Using AI to reconstruct historical mysteries: Sino-Tibetan Languages([CIEL'15](https://www.ciel-15.com/#/)).
- Protect endangered languages: Automatic Transcription([IC2S2'10](https://ic2s2-2024.org/)), Social Media([ICA'74, Beijing](https://www.icahdq.org/mpage/ica24)).
- Others: Machine Learning Benchmark for Databases ([Arxiv'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16837v1))

<!-- **Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. I am currently focused on developing transferable techniques to improve generative models, including their training methodologies, architecture design, alignment, robustness, evaluation techniques and inference efficiency. I am also interested in generative modeling as a tool for scientific discovery. I invented many foundational concepts and techniques in (score-based) diffusion models, for which you can find more in a [blog post](/blog/2021/score/) and a [quanta magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-physics-principle-that-inspired-modern-ai-art-20230105/). -->
