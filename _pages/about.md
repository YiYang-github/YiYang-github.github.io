Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, supervised by <a href="https://biweihuang.com/">Prof. Biwei Huang</a>. Prior to UCSD, I earned my Statistics Bachelor‚Äôs degree from the <a href="https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">School of the Gifted Young</a>, University of Science and Technology of China in June 2025. During my undergrad, I am passionate about applying ML algorithms with statistical intuition to gain insights into interdisciplinary areas, like language acquisition, the documentation and phylogeny of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages">Sino-Tibetan Languages</a>. Please check my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Yi_Yang.pdf">CV (PDF)</a> and the blog <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=RDdQw4w9WgXcQ&start_radio=1">A Summary of Undergrad Research</a> for more.

## Research


I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of the world through a causal lens. I focus on discovering and embedding cause-effect relationships in complex, real-world environments across three key levels:


* **Theoretical Guarantees: General and Scalable Causal Discovery**
    The central aim in many scientific fields is to elucidate cause-effect relationships. I work on developing general and scalable causal discovery algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. A key focus is extending these algorithms to reliably handle large-scale scenarios in the presence of hidden confounders, missing values, distribution shifts, and selection bias.

* **Causal-Inspired Interpretability: Understanding Neural Networks and Human Brains**
    Neural networks have shown the promise of general intelligence, like human brains, beyond simple memorization. My goal is to move beyond traditional association-based interpretability methods to perform post-analysis on core ML frameworks (e.g., transformers, diffusion models, and agentic systems) with a causal perspective, making them more white-box and controllable. Concurrently, I wish to explore the causal mechanisms of the human brain, aiming to unify insights from both fields.

* **Causality-Empowered AI**
    By synthesizing theoretical guarantees with intuitions from causal interpretability, my long-term vision is to develop an infant-like architecture that can automatically discover latent causal features and relationships from data.

## Miscellaneous

One of my biggest dreams is to create a full-length animated film, designed in the aesthetic of traditional Chinese calligraphy, painting, and literature. I hope to make it a reality somedayü•πÔºÅ

If anything interests you, I am happy to introduce them to you in detail!

<!-- The past three years at USTC have been quite an interesting and unconventional life experience for me‚ÄîI entered university a year early, majored in Statistics, took five courses in Communications, and explored AI and Linguistics... I still remember, as a freshman in 2021(the age befrom Chatgpt) when the [Nobel Physics Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/summary/) was awarded for complex networks, I read through the entire background introduction (the [PDF](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/sciback_fy_en_21.pdf)). At that time, I realized two things‚Äîthat there are no necessary boundaries between disciplines, as many topics of interest are the same but manifest in different forms, and that learning inherently from data, instead of us humans setting symbolic rules, is more promising for uncovering the mechanisms of complex systems‚Äîwhich motivated me to self-study AI courses on the Internet and choose interdisciplinary research, leading me step by step to where I am today.

[Chinese calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy), the supreme and representative art of Chinese culture, has accompanied me since childhood, helping me to calm down and focus. More interestingly, I was fortunate to further learn how to make a Chinese Calligraphy Brush from scratch on an elective course when I got to university. Reading, movies, and music always bring me joy amidst the trivialities of daily life. -->
