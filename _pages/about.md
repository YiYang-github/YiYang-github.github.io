Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a senior undergard at USTC. In the past 3 years, I participated a series of interdisciplinary research in linguistics and machine learning. Please check my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Yi_Yang.pdf">CV (PDF)</a> and information below for more.


## Research

**Goal**: My long-term goal is to develop and rethink AI tools from two perspectives: first, by developing powerful ML algorithms to benefit society—such as the revitalization of indigenous languages; second, by retesting models in meaningful scenarios to explore their capability limits, assess their similarity to human cognition, and gain insights that advance our understanding of ourselves and improve these models.


**Developing powerful ML algorithms for Social Good**
- Automated Tone Toolkit for Low-resource Indigeneous Sino-Tibetan Languages ([EMNLP'2024 Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02324))
- Machine Unlearning for Structural Data Privacy ([WWW'2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02835))

**Exploring Linguistic Theories by Computational Modelling**
- Can Machines Perceive Speech in Human-like Poverty of the Stimulus Environments? ([Manuscript](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dRqrj2mADOAAxQYYRpHbt3IlbmWaMftO?usp=sharing)).
- Is Bayesian Phylogenetics Really Reliable for Language Evolutions? ([Manuscript](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dRqrj2mADOAAxQYYRpHbt3IlbmWaMftO?usp=sharing)).

## Miscellaneous


The past three years at USTC have been quite an interesting and unconventional life experience for me—I entered university a year early, majored in Statistics, took five courses in Communications, and explored AI and Linguistics... I still remember, as a freshman in 2021(the age befrom Chatgpt) when the [Nobel Physics Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/summary/) was awarded for complex networks, I read through the entire background introduction (the [PDF](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2021/10/sciback_fy_en_21.pdf)). At that time, I realized two things—that there are no necessary boundaries between disciplines, as many topics of interest are the same but manifest in different forms, and that learning inherently from data, instead of us humans setting symbolic rules, is more promising for uncovering the mechanisms of complex systems—which motivated me to self-study AI courses on the Internet and choose interdisciplinary research, leading me step by step to where I am today.

[Chinese calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy), the supreme and representative art of Chinese culture, has accompanied me since childhood, helping me to calm down and focus. More interestingly, I was fortunate to further learn how to make a Chinese Calligraphy Brush from scratch on an elective course when I got to university. Reading, movies, and music always bring me joy amidst the trivialities of daily life.
 
If you are interested in any of these, I am happy to introduce them to you in detail!
