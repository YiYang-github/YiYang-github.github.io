Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a research intern at [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mark Liberman](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~myl/), working on the reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan Language evolutions.

## Research

**Goal**: My long-term goal is to develop human-centered and powerful AI tools that can systematically protect our diverse and brilliant civilization, and understand how we humans perceive the wonderful yet complex world. To achieve this, I have been dedicated to a series of interdisciplinary and deeply interconnected research projects in linguistics, machine learning, and statistics since my freshman year, including:

- Protecting endangered languages: Automatic Tone Transcription([IC2S2'10](https://ic2s2-2024.org/), [By request](https://yiyang-github.github.io/), [ICA'74, Beijing](https://www.icahdq.org/mpage/ica24))
- Language Acquisition: Poverty of the Stimulus([By request](https://yiyang-github.github.io/)).
- Language Evolutions: Sino-Tibetan Languages([CIEL'15](https://www.ciel-15.com/#/)).
- Responsible AI: Machine Unlearning([WWW'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02835)).
- Others: Machine Learning Benchmark for Databases ([Arxiv'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16837v1))

**Why Research**: Benefiting from [the School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/)'s flexible curriculum, I got the opportunity to take many valuable courses in Communications, Machine Learning, Arts, and Humanities.

## Hobbies

I have been practicing [Calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy) since childhood. My favorite calligrapher is [Yan Zhenqing(颜真卿)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Zhenqing), exemplified by the [(Draft of a Requiem to My Nephew)(祭侄文稿)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E7%A5%AD%E5%A7%AA%E6%96%87%E7%A8%BF). Interestingly, I was fortunate to learn how to make a Chinese Calligraphy Brush Pen from [She Zhengjun(佘征军)](https://m.163.com/dy/article/GQUD5SOR0552AD0X.html?spss=adap_pc) at university, a well-known intangible cultural heritage inheritor in China.

Reading, movies, and music always bring me joy amidst the trivialities of daily life, allowing me to appreciate the precious humanistic passion.I love folk and jazz songs composed before the artists became famous, as they often reveal the most authentic stories, emotions, and expressions of we ordinary people. I highly recommend poets like [Mu Dan(穆旦)](), [Byron](), and [Whitman](), represented by excellent poems such as [The Night Watchman(更夫)](http://www.shigeku.com/shiku/xs/mudan.htm#9), [When We Two Parted](), and [Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage]().

As for novels, I have a broad interest in Chinese classical literature like [The Peony Pavilion(牡丹亭)]() and [Dream of the Red Chamber(红楼梦)](), as well as writers such as [Virginia Woolf](), [James Joyce](), [Kafka](), [Austen](), [Eileen Chang(张爱玲)](), and [Lu Yao(路遥)](), with works like [A Hunger Artist](), [The Waves](), [Life](), and [New Stories](). My favorite movies are [Dead Poets Society]() and [The Goddess(神女)](). I admire directors including [Kubrick](), [Spielberg](), [Edward Yang(杨德昌)](), [Wong Kar-wai(王家卫)](), and [Shunji Iwai(いわいしゅんじ)]().

If you are interested in any of these, I am happy to introduce them to you in detail!

I maintain a regular exercise routine that includes activities like running, badminton, swimming, and more.



## Miscellaneous

During my high school and university years, I endured a prolonged and arduous period of confusion where I felt that my dreams and talents were overshadowed by the relentless pressures of reality. Regrettably, I found myself gradually assimilating into the realm of societal excellence, yet losing sight of my unique individuality.

However, as time passed, I came to realize that genuine liberation can only be achieved by passionately pursuing what truly ignites my soul. It is my earnest desire that these words resonate with those who find themselves enveloped in the haze of uncertainty. Once again,I extend my deepest gratitude to my loved ones for their unwavering presence and steadfast support throughout it all.
